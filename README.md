### → Installation

**Please note that I would rather you not run another instance of the bot and just invite it to your server. If you really want to run it with your own token for testing or another reason, please follow the directions below to run it. If your computer has two versions of python and / or you have python 2 and python 3 installed make sure to use python 3.**

There is a requirements.txt file that anyone on **Any Operating That Supports Python 3** can use to install **All** of the dependences needed for LinuxBoi to run. Installation instructions are below as follows:

* First install this dependency and built from source. This is a bitly api dependency for a shortenlink command.
```
git clone https://github.com/bitly/bitly-api-python.git

cd bitly-api-python/

python setup.py install

or

python3 setup.py install

```

* Next clone this repo and install the dependencies from the txt file.

```
git clone https://github.com/TrackRunny/LinuxBoi.git

cd LinuxBoi

pip install --user --requirement requirements.txt

or

Congrats, everything should be set up correctly so far. If you want to start the bot you can do `./LinuxBoi.py` as it should already be executiable.
