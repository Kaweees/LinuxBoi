                    <ul>
                        <li>This was email sent from a Discord Bot known as LinuxBoi!</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Why was this sent to me?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This email was sent to you because someone in Discord ran this command and they entered your email address.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Is this email a scam, spam, ect?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No of course not! Someone just wanted to send you a email using a Discord bot. Thats all it is to it!</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4>Can someone spam this and bomb people's emails?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No, the command has built in protection that allows 1 email to be sent every 30 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>

>>>>>>> 191a1e9... Added email command
                <h4>I don't want to see anymore emails from whoever is running the command anymore please.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sure! Just block this email address and you will never see another email again!</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Why does the person not just send a email through their regular address / email client?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They could not have access to their email right now! However they could be just doing this to save time and not open their email client and send a email.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Okay, this sounds alright then can I have a invite link to the Discord Bot please?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Of course! Invite the bot here:<a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://bit.ly/2ZfozfL"> Click here!</a></li>
